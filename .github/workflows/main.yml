In this project, we performed web scraping to extract table data from a webpage and save it in a structured format. First, we imported the necessary libraries: requests to fetch web pages, BeautifulSoup to parse HTML, and pandas to manage and process the data. Next, we specified the URL of the target webpage and used requests.get() to fetch it, followed by parsing the HTML with BeautifulSoup. We then located the required table, which in this case was the second table on the page (position 1), although it could also be identified by its class attribute for more precision. After locating the table, we extracted all the rows (<tr> tags) and pulled the individual cell data (<td> tags) from each row. This extracted data was then stored in a pandas DataFrame, where each row and cell was structured properly. Finally, we exported the DataFrame into a CSV file, successfully converting the table into clean, structured data for future use.
